# Class 4: Naive Bayes from scratch

Note: Changes to this plan may occur

### TL:DR
 - Required:
   - Make sure you have a working `Text` class which are able to return n-grams of a given text as well as a token frequencies.
   - make sure you are familiar with numpy e.g. using [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Numpy_Arrays)
 - Highly recommended:
   - Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA) on naive bayes.
   - read the homework assignment on sentiment to prepare any question you might want to ask on the structure of the script
 - Recommended
   - Bring the data you want to classify 
 - Optional
   - read the paper:[Idiot's Bayes: Not So Stupid after All?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1403452?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
   - read the paper: [The Optimality of Naive Bayes](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~hzhang/publications/FLAIRS04ZhangH.pdf)



We will be implementing Naive Bayes in the class or at least get started doing it. To make the it easy to follow please make sure you have a good understanding of the Naive Bayes classification. In addition to the reading I personally recommend the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA) by Josh Starmer on his youtube channel statquest. This is in generally a highly recommended channel for getting a initial understanding for statistical methods. For the class I will also use numpy arrays so you might want to [familiarize yourself](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Numpy_Arrays) with them.

## Plan for Class
- Take question on the assignment
- Go through the mathematical underpinnings for Naive Bayes
- Implement the Naive Bayes

---

## HW2: Sentiment
This class is intended to prepare you for the homework assignment on sentiment. I highly recommend that you read the assignment to prepare any question you might want to ask during class. 

## Using your own data
In this class we will be doing classification using Naive Bayes. You have any kind of text data that you would like ot classify using this method feel free to bring that instead.
